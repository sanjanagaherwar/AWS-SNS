# AWS-SNS
This project was just made for testing SNS SMS service for Manastik.
Without using the aws console, just by using js SDK and providing the number and message in the code, how sns sends the message to the mentioned number.
Only if the account is in Sandbox, you will have to verfiy numbers.
